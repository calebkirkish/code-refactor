01-HTML-CSS-Git: Code Refactor

<!--
INTRODUCTION

When first presented with this assignment, I thought it looked as perfect as could be. I couldn't be more wrong by that description.

when I started scrolling through the document I noticed that there were several redundant pieces of code in the cascading style sheet

file that kept repeating the same as some other classes. There was also a broken link that would not work, that was an easy fix since

the other links were working and just found the missing elements inside the class. I also noticed that there were lots of places where

the <div></div> were being used, some of them were where the header was and footer and made no sense to make those into divion selector 

sections. 

PURPOSE FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT

I believe this project was to help clear out much of the unnecessary code out and make it more organized to help increase the output of 

the code. The other purpose of this website is to help people with disabilities that can't see the images being outputted so we can describe 

some of the pictures they can't really view. This assignment really helps with knowing how rthe code functions and what you can use to help 

organize the code a little better so it's not so meticulous. 

CONCLUSION

I realize when I did this assignment I should have been pushing up little changes to the code so as to help with organizing what changes I have 

made in the past and how easily rectify any issues I made run into when I do that. -->
